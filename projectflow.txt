1. Create a git repo and clone it into local
2. Create code.py and add code in it. (it will sae a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git commit -push before initializing dvc.
4. Now we do "DVC init" (create .gitignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir S3" (Create a new S3 Directory)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Next "dvc add data/" 
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
